# Mike Higazy here. It's been 9 months since we started this project.
# The system works, somehow. We're not sure how.
# Most of us are divorced now. Steve lives in the server room permanently.
# But hey, the reimbursements are processed on time!
# 
# If you're reading this in the future, please remember us.
# We gave our marriages for your travel expenses. 
# If you need to reach me, please email my unborn grandson Sherif Higazy,
